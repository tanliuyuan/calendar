Creative Features:
1. Bootstrap for better looking UI.
2. Events have duration, and events that last longer than 24 hours will go across date cells on the calendar.
3. Users can switch between month, day, and week views.
4. There are admins and common users. Admins can add/edit/delete public events. Public events can be seen by all logged in users, but can only be modified/deleted by admins, while private events can only be seen by the user who created the event. Public events are displayed in orange on the calendar, while private ones are in blue. 
Admin username: admin, password: password
